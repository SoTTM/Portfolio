# I am a Data Scientist who works on Deep Learning models!

*Hi, I'm Soheil Tabatabaei Mortazavi*

> Today, I am embarking on a journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) includes Machine Learning models, Deep Learning, Generative Ai (computer vision) and a lot of computer vision projects focused on images and videos.

> Previously, I pursued studies in Control Engineering, where I explored the principles of stabilizing and controlling robots. Subsequently, I ventured into the 3D printing industry, working with FFF and DLP 3D printers. This experience ignited my interest in finding practical applications for 3D printing.

> During my time working in startups, I faced numerous challenges related to teamwork, startup dynamics, and scalability issues. These experiences provided me with valuable insights into markets and the importance of customer engagement. This led me to pursue self-education in marketing.

> My fascination with AI eventually drew me to the field. I focused on developing deep learning models, particularly in the area of Computer Vision. I continue to hone my skills in this area, striving to become a proficient data scientist.

> Throughout my career, I have been guided by the following messages:

> • Electrical Engineering: "Control Motors, Control Robots, Make the World a Better Place!" and "Customize Things!"

> • Marketing: "Know What Makes the World a Better Place, Grow Your Startup, then Scale Everything Else!" and "Customize Your Service!"

> • AI: "You Want to influence? Gather Data for Everything, Design Models for It Better than Others, Analyze It for the Best Purpose, then Use the Results for a Better Place on Earth!"

> If you are a data scientist or AI_visioner or an related Company,  I believe It may be possible that my diverse experiences and passion for AI make me an ideal candidate for you. Want to test this? just talk to me! (sttmcanopus@gmail.com)

> I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and make a positive impact in the world.
